The Datadog agent faithfully collects events and metrics and brings
them to [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com) on your behalf so that
you can do something with your monitoring and performance data.

You're looking at the source code right now. We provide a number of
[pre-packaged binaries](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for your convenience.

# How to configure the agent

If you are using packages on linux, the main configuration file lives 
in `/etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf`. Per-check configuration files are in
`/etc/dd-agent/conf.d`. We provide and example in the same directory
that you can use as a template.
